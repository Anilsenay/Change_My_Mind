# Change_My_Mind

I took a break for project for a while

<h3>An android debate app. My first Android app and mobile UI design.</h3>

<h5>Here is UI design I worked : https://xd.adobe.com/view/2509f1ec-1bda-4b9d-4d1c-35ffb7930dd8-5338/grid?hints=off</h5>

The logic of application is simple. A user(X) write his opinion on any subject, </br>
another user(Y), who thinks he/she can change X user's opinion, wants to join debate by sending request from debate page.</br>
If X accept his challenge request, their debate is starting. </br>
First round, Y will present his/her argument against X's first argument.</br>
Then round 1 will be ended, round 2 will be started by X's next argument.</br>
End of all rounds, If X changed his/her opinion, Y will get point and win the debate.</br>
If X does not change opinion, community users will vote the debate.</br>
